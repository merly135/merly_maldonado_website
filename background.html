    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Marin General Hospital on June 22, 2002 and I have lived in San Rafael my entire life in the canal area. I've lived in an apartment my entire life but there were always kids to play with outside. The apartment building also has a pool and grass so we had plenty of space outside. I am Guatemalan American with dual citizenship.

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>In my family, I have two brothers, one half sister and my parents. My sister lived in Guatemala her entire life with my grandma and just recently moved to Petaluma. I met her when I was 12 and she is nine years older than me. I'm the middle child between my two brothers. My little brother is only a year younger than me so we basically grew up as twins. My big brother is four years older than me.

    <h2>Interesting Stories</h2>
    <p>
        My parents met each other because my dad worked for my mom's dad. They were together as teens but my dad came to the US. My mom met another man on the coast (she lived in the mountains) and had my sister named Rosmery. Since there was a lack of jobs and money, she cam to the US and unfortuneately could not bring my sister. her plan was to go back to Guatemala but she reunited with my dad again and had my big brother, Jony. Still wanting to go back to Guatemala, she had my brother and I. Now my whole family is in the US.
